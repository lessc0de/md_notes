## Reader Writer problem
Imaging you had a key-value map data structure which is used by many threads. Multiple threads should be able to look up (read) values at the same time provided the data structure is not being written to. The writers are not so gregarious - to avoid data corruption, only one thread at a time may modify (write) the data structure (and no readers may be reading at that time).

This is an example of the _Reader Writer Problem_. How can we efficiently synchronize multiple readers and writers such that multiple readers can read together but a writer gets exclusive access?

The attempt below is incorrect:

<table><tr><td>
<pre>read()
  lock(m)
  // do read stuff
  unlock(m)
</pre>
</td><td>
<pre>write()
  lock(m)
  // do write stuff
  unlock(m)
</pre></td></tr></table>

In this attempt, readers must wait from other readers... hmm, that's not good. Let's try another implementation:

<table>
<tr>
	<td>
		<pre>
read() {
	while (writing) { /* spin */ }
	reading = 1
	// do read stuff
	reading = 0
}
		</pre>
	</td>
	<td>
		<pre>
write() {
	while (reading || writing) { /* spin */ }
	writing = 1
	// do write stuff
	writing = 0
}
		</pre>
	</td>
</table>

Our above implementation suffers from a race condition. What if one thread called `read` at the same time as another thread called `write`?

Here is yet another attempt:

<table>
<tr>
	<td>
		<pre>
read() {
	lock(&m)
	while (writers)
		cond_wait(&cv, &m);
	readers++
	// do read stuff
	readers--
	cond_signal(&cv)
	unlock(&m)
}
		</pre>
	</td>
	<td>
		<pre>
write() {
	lock(&m)
	while (readers || writers)
		cond_wait(&cv, &m);
	writers++
	// do write stuff
	writers--
	cond_signal(&cv)
	unlock(&m)
}
		</pre>
	</td>
</table>

This implementation appears to work, but has several drawbacks.

* readers are STILL competing against each other!
* if there is a constant stream of readers, writers will never have access


## Ring Buffer
A ring buffer is a fixed-sized storage mechanism where contiguous memory is treated as if it is circular, and two index counters keep track of the current beginning and end of queue. As array indexing is not circular, the index counters must wrap around to zero when moved past the end of the array. As data is added (enqueued) to the front or removed (dequeued) from the tail, the current items in the buffer form a train that appears to circle the track.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/angrave/SystemProgramming/RingBuffer-Angrave2014-1024x768.png)

A simple single-threaded implementation is shown below. Note enqueue and dequeue do not guard against underflow/overflow. We'll fix this problem later in the multi-threaded version:
```C
void *buffer[16];
int in = 0, out = 0;

void enqueue(void* value) { /* Add one item to the front of the queue */
	buffer[in] = value;
	in++;  /* Advance the index for next time */
	if (in == 16) in = 0;  /* Wrap around! */
}

void* dequeue() { /* Remove one item from the end of the queue */
	void* result = buffer[out];
	out++;
	if (out == 16) out = 0;
	return result;
}
```

And here is the correct, single-threaded implementation of our ring buffer:
```C
#include <pthread.h>
#include <semaphore.h>
// N must be 2&i
#define N (16)

void *b[N];
int in = 0, out = 0;
pthread_mutex_t lock = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
sem_t countsem, spacesem;

void init() {
	sem_init(&countsem, 0, 0);
	sem_init(&spacesem, 0, 16);
}

void enqueue(void *value) {
	// wait if there is no space left
	sem_wait(&spacesem);

	pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
	b[ (in++) & (N-1) ] = value;
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);

	// increment the count of the number of items
	sem_post(&countsem);
}

void* dequeue() {
	// wait if there are no items in the buffer
	sem_wait(&countsem);

	pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
	void* result = b[ (out++) & (N-1) ];
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);

	// increment the count of the number of spaces
	sem_post(&spacesem);

	return result;
}
```

Finally, here is the multi-threaded version:
```C
int writers;  // Number of writer threads that want to enter critical section
int writing;  // Number of threads currently writing inside C.S.
int reading;  // Number of threads currently reading inside C.S.

reader() {
	// don't read if there are writers
	// cv's require mutex
	// reading++ modifies state: requires mutex
	lock(&m)
	while (writers)
		cond_wait(&cv, &m)
	reading++
	unlock(&m)

	/* Read here! */

	// tell write threads they can write!
	// cv's require mutex
	// reading-- modifies state: requires mutex
	lock(&m);
	reading--;
	cond_broadcast(&cv);
	unlock(&m);
}

write() {  // keep mutex throughout write, only 1 write at a time
	// don't write while reading or writing
	lock(&m);
	writers++
	while (reading || writing)
		cond_wait(&cv, &m)
	writing++
	unlock(&m)

	/* Write here! */

	// broadcast to write threads (with writing--) and read threads (with writers--)!
	// cv's require mutex
	// writing-- and writers-- mutate state: requires mutex
	lock(&m)
	writing--
	writers--
	cond_broadcast(&cv);
	unlock(&m);
}
```


## Deadlock
There are 4 necessary and sufficient conditions for deadlock. These are known as the _Coffman conditions_.

* Mutual Exclusion
* Circular Wait
* Hold and Wait
* No pre-emption

All of these conditions are required for deadlock.

* Mutual Exclusion - The resource cannot be shared.
* Circular Wait - There exists a cycle in the Resource Allocation Graph. This means that there exists a set of processes `{P1,P2,...}` such that `P1` is waiting for resources held by `P2`, which is waiting for `P3`, ..., which is waiting for `P1`. 
* Hold and Wait - A process/thread acquires an incomplete set of resources and holds onto them while waiting for the other resources.
* No pre-emption - Once a process/thread has acquired a resource, the resource cannot be taken away from a process/thread and the process/thread will not voluntarily give up a resource.

### Examples
Two students need a pen and paper:

* The students share a pen and paper. Deadlock is avoided because Mutual Exclusion was not required.
* The students both agree to grab the pen before grabbing the paper. Deadlock is avoided because there cannot be a circular wait.
* The students grab both the pen and paper in one operation ("Get both or get none"). Deadlock is avoided because there is no _Hold and Wait_.
* The students are friends and will ask each other to give up a held resource. Deadlock is avoided because pre-emption is allowed.

### Livelock
Livelock _is not_ deadlock. Consider the following solution:

* The students will put down one held resource if they are unable to pick up the other resource within 10 seconds. This solution avoid deadlock, but it may suffer from livelock.

Lifelock occurs when a process continues to execute but is unable to make progress. In practice, _livelock_ may occur because the programmer has taken steps to avoid deadlock. In the above example, in a busy system, the student will continually release the first resource because they are never able to obtain the second resource (every 10 seconds). The system is not in deadlock (the student process is still executing), but it's not making any progress.

A good story to illustrate this problem is the case where a husband and wife are trying to eat soup, but only one has a spoon between them. Each spouse is too polite and will thus pass the spoon if the other hasn't eaten yet. The couple will pass the spoon non-stop since both haven't eaten to begin with.

Another example would be two socially awkward strangers trying to get past each other in a narrow corridor. Each time one person moves to the left side, the other one does too, blocking both their movement. So the first person moves to the right again, but the other one does too almost at the same time, thus blocking each other again. They will repeat this fumbling livelock over and over again (or for some finite but large amount of time).
