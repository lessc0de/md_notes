# Systems Programming

## Pthreads
Pthreads are "POSIX" threads. They're a thread implementation for POSIX systems. A thread will have its own stack of automatic variables and function calls.

### Hello World
```C
int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr,
				   void* (*start_routine) (void *), void* arg);
```

* `thread` is a pointer to the thread id
* `attr` is a pointer to the attributes assigned to be assigned to this thread
* `start_routine` is a function that we want to run
* `arg` is the argument to our `start_routine` function

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>

void* busy (void *ptr) {
	puts("Hello World");
	return NULL;
}

int main() {
	pthread_t id;
	pthread_create(&id, NULL, busy, "Hi");
	while (1) {}  // loop forever
}
```

### Exiting threads
Threads can exit with:

* returning from the thread function
* parent calling `pthread_exit`
* canceling the thread with `pthread_cancel` (asynchronous, no cleanup)
* terminate the process (e.g. `SIGTERM`), `exit()`, or returning from `main()`

### `pthread_join`
`pthread_join` waits for a child thread to finish. It also cleans up thread resources properly. If you don't call `pthread_join`, the finished threads will continue to consume resources. Eventually, if enough threads are created, `pthread_create` will fail. In practice, this is only an issue for long-runing processes but isn't an issue for simple, short-lived processes as thread resources are automatically freed when the process exits.

`pthread_join` will block until the thread finishes. `pthread_exit` ends them immediately and returns immediately.

`pthread_join` is also good when you need to care about the lifetime of stack/automatic variables:
```C
pthread start_threads() {
	int start = 42;
	pthread_t tid;
	pthread_create(&tid, NULL, myfunc, &start);
	return tid;  // tid hasn't been created yet, UH-OH
}
```
Above, the thread takes a while to create, but `start_threads()` already returned! We need to block until the thread is done!
```C
void start_threads() {
	int start = 42;
	void* result;
	pthread_t tid;
	pthread_create(&tid, NULL, myfunc, &start);
	pthread_join(tid, &result);  // block until myfunc is done
}
```

### Gotcha
Consider the following example:
```C
#include <pthread.h>

void* myfunc(void* ptr) {
	int i = *((int*) ptr);
	printf("%d ", i);
	return NULL;
}

int main() {
	pthread_t tid;
	int i;
	for (i=0; i < 10; i++) {
		pthread_create(&tid, NULL, myfunc, &i);  // ERROR
	}
	pthread_exit(NULL);
}
```
The above suffers from a race condition - the value of `i` is changing. To overcome, fence off the memory for each thread:
```C
struct T {
  thread_t id;
  int start;
  char result[100];
}

...

struct T *info = calloc(10, sizeof(struct T));
pthread_create(&info[i].id, NULL, func, &info[i]);
```

## Mutex Locks
Mutexes are also from `pthread.h`.
```C
pthread_mutex_t *lock = malloc(sizeof(pthread_mutex_t));
pthread_mutex_init(lock, NULL);
// later
pthread_mutex_destroy(lock);
free(lock);
```
The above uses `pthread_mutex_init` and `pthread_mutex_destroy` to create a lock. The following is a simpler alternative:
```C
pthread_mutex_t m = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
...
pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
// later
pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
```

## Semaphores
Semaphores are containers around a count variable and supports two operations - "wait" and "post". "Post" increments the count and returns immediately. "Wait" will wait if the count is zero; if the count is non-zero, it will decrement the count and return immediately.

An analogy is the count of tools in the toolbox. If there are no more tools, then `wait` will block until there is at least one tool. `wait` effectively takes an available tool from the toolbox and uses it, or waits to do so when there is an available one. `post` "returns" the tool back to the toolbox, hence increasing the count by 1.

```C
sem_t s;

int main() {
	sem_init(&s, 0, 10);  // returns -1 (=FAILED) on OS X
	sem_wait(&s);  // could do this 10 times without blocking
	sem_post(&s);  // announce that we've finished using the resource (and 1 more resource is available)
	sem_destroy(&s);  // release resources of the semaphore
}
```
Semaphores have more overhead tham a mutex. Whereas a mutex restricts the resource for one, semaphore can restrict for more than one (i.e. `count`).

## How are mutexes implemented?
There are 3 main desirable properties for a mutex:

* Mutual Exclusion - the thread/process gets exclusive access; others must wait until it exits the critical section
* Bounded Wait - if the thread/process has to wait, then it should only have to wait for a finite amount of time
* Progress - if no thread/process is inside the critical section, then the thread/process should be able to proceed (make progress) without having to wait

Here is Peterson's solution:

> raise my flag
> turn = myid
> wait until your flag is lowered or turn is yourid
> // do critical section stuff\
> lower my flag

```C
bool flag[0] = false;
bool flag[1] = false;
int turn;
```
thread 0:
```C
P0:			flag[0] = true;
P0_gate:	turn = 1;
			while (flag[1] && turn == 1) {}  // busy wait
			// critical section
			...
			// end of critical section
			flag[0] = false;

P1:			flag[1] = true;
P0_gate:	turn = 0;
			while (flag[0] && turn == 0) {}  // busy wait
			// critical section
			...
			// end of critical section
			flag[1] = false;
```


## Condition Variables
```C
pthread_cond_t cv;
pthread_mutex_t m;
int count;

// Initialize
pthread_cond_init(&cv, NULL);
pthread_mutex_init(&m, NULL);
count = 0;

pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
while (count < 10) {
	pthread_cond_wait(&cv, &m);  /* unlock m, wait, lock m */
}
pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);

// later clean up with pthread_cond_destroy and mutex_destroy

// in another thread increment count:
while (1) {
	pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
	count++;
	pthread_cond_signal(&cv);
	/* even though the other thread is woken up it will not return
	we unlock the mutex */
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
}
```

Why do we need to lock the mutex before signaling/waiting-for the conditional variable, i.e. surrounding conditional variable access with mutex?

First, let's answer what is the motivation/point of conditional variables? Conditional variables are used when, after a mutex is acquired, a set of instructions is to be executed when a _condition_ is fulfilled. If the _condition_ is not fulfilled, the mutex is unlocked and the process repeats.
```C++
while (data != 1) {
	pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
	if (!q.empty()) {
		data = q.back();
		q.pop_back();
		pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
		cout << "t2 got a value from t1: " << data << endl;
	} else {
		pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
	}
}
```
Notice above we didn't use a conditional variable even though it could have been used. The above code is inefficient because the code will lock/unlock repeatedly when `q.empty()`. This is better:
```C++
while (data != 1) {
	pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
	//pthread_cond_wait(&cv, &m);
	//if (!q.empty()) {  // spurious wakeup
	//	pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
	//	continue;
	//}
	while (!q.empty()) pthread_cond_wait(&cv, &m);  // spurious wakeup
	data = q.back();
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
	cout << "t2 got a value from t1: " << endl;
}

// thread 1:
pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
q.push_front(count);
pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
pthread_cond_signal(&cv);  // notify one thread
```

### Implementing a semaphore with condition variables
```C
typedef struct sem_t {
	int count;
	pthread_mutex_t m;
	pthread_condition_t cv;
} sem_t;

int sem_init(sem_t *s, int pshared, int value) {
	if (pshared) { errno = ENOSYS /* Not implemented */; return -1; }

	s->count = value;
	pthread_mutex_init(&s->m, NULL);
	pthred_condition_init(&s->cv, NULL);
	return 0;
}

void sem_wait(sem_t *s) {
	pthread_mutex_lock(&s->m);
	while (s->count == 0) pthread_cond_wait(&s->cv, &s->m);
	s->count--;
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&s->m);
}

void sem_post(sem_t *s) {
	pthread_mutex_lock(&s->m);
	s->count++;
	// if statement for more efficiency
	if (s->count == 1) pthread_cond_signal(&s->cv);
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&s->m);
}
```


## Thread Synchronization
Suppose we wanted to perform a large multi-threaded calculation that has two stages but we don't want to advance to the second stage until the first stage is completed. This is the same as `__waitSync()`.
```C
double data[256][8192]

// 1. Threads do first calculation (use and change values in data)
// 2. Barrier! Wait for all threads to finish first calculation before continuing
// 3. Threads do second calculation (use and change values in data)
```
The thread function has four main parts:
```C
void* calc (void* arg) {
	/* Do my part of the first calculation */
	/* Am I the last thread to finish? If so, wake up all other threads! */
	/* Otherwise wait until the other threads have finished part one */
	/* Do my part of the second calculation */
}
```
Our main thread will create 16 threads and divide the calculation into 16 separate pieces. Each thread will be given a unique value (0, 1, 2, .., 15), so it can work on its own block. Since a `(void)` type can hold small integers, we will pass the value of `i` by casting it to a void:
```C
#define N (16)

double data[256][8192];

int main() {
	pthread_t ids[N];
	for (int i=0; i<N; i++)
		pthread_create(&ids[i], NULL, calc, (void *) i);
}
```
_Note: We use the argument as `void*`; don't dereference it!_

Here is our calculation function:
```C
void* calc (void* arg) {
	int start = N * (int) ptr;
	int end = start + N;
	for (int x=start; x<end; x++) {
		for (int y=0; y < 8192; y++) {
			/* do calc part 1 */
		}
	}
}
```
After calculation 1 completes we need to wait for the slower threads (unless we are the last thread!). So keep track of the number of threads that have arrived at our barrier aka "checkpoint":
```C
pthread_mutex_t m;
pthread_cond_t cv;

main() {
	pthread_mutex_init(&m, NULL);
	pthread_cond_init(&cv, NULL);
	pthread_t ids[N];
	int remain = N;

	for (int i=0; i<N; i++)
		pthread_create(&ids[i], NULL, calc, (void *) i);

	pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
	remain--;  // We finished creating threads
	if (remain == 0) { pthread_cond_broadcast(&cv); }
	else {
		// while loop for spurious wakes
		while (remain != 0) { pthread_cond_wait(&cv, &m); }
	}
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
}
```
