# 7.9 Write a string sinusoidally
Write a program which takes as input a string `s` and returns the snakestring of `s`. We define the snakestring of `s` to be left-right top-to-bottom sequence in which characters appear when `s` is written in sinusoidal fashion. For example, the snakestring for "Hello World" is "e lHloWrdlo!"

## My Solution
What is the parameterization of the snakestring?

```
"Hello World"

 e   _   l
H l o W r d
   l   o   !

"e lHloWrdlo!"

0  H   3
1  e 0
2  l   4
3  l     9
4  o   5
5  _ 1
6  W   6
7  o     10
8  r   7
9  l 2
10 d   8
11 !     11

top-phase: 1 -> 5 -> 9 -> .. -> 1 + 4i < s.size(), i=0..
mid-phase: 0 -> 2 -> 4 -> .. -> 2j     < s.size(), j=0..
bot-phase: 3 -> 7 -> 11-> .. -> 3 + 4k < s.size(), k=0..
```


Here is the algorith implementation of the parameterization.
```C++
string SnakeString (string const& s) {
    string snake;
    
    // top-phase
    for (int i = 0; 1 + 4*i < s.size(); i += 4)
        snake += s[1 + 4*i];
    // mid-phase
    for (int j = 0; 2*j < s.size(); j += 2)
        snake += s[2*j];
    // bot-phase
    for (int k = 0; 3 + 4*k < s.size(); k += 4)
        snake += s[3 + 4*k];

    return snake;
}
```

Time is `O(n)`, where `n` is the size of the string `s`. Extra space complexity is `O(1)`.


# 7.10 Implement run-length encoding
Run-length encoding (RLE) compression offers a fast way to do efficient on-the-fly compression and decompression of strings. The idea is simple - encode successive repeated characters by the repetition count and the character. For example, the RLE of "aaaabcccaa" is "4a1b3c2a". The decoding of "3e4f2e" returns "eeeffffee".

Implement run-length encoding and decoding functions. Assume the string to be encoded consists of letters of the alphabet, with no digits, and the string to be decoded is a valid encoding.

_Hint: This is similar to converting between binary and string representations._

## My Solution
```
eeefghh       O(n)
e           
f
g
hh          k
3e1f1g2h

O(n) time
O(n) space
```


```C++
string RunLengthEncoding (string const& s) {
    // let k = num_consec_sub_seq
    int k = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < s.size(); i++)
        if (s[i] != s[i - 1]) k++;

    string encoding(2*k, '0');
    // read again and store into encoding
    int write_ind = 0;
    int len_sub_seq = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < s.sie(); i++) {
        if (s[i] != s[i - 1]) {
            encoding[write_ind] = len_sub_seq + '0';
            encoding[write_ind + 1] = s[i - 1];
            len_sub_seq = 1;
            write_ind += 2;
        }
    }
    return encoding;
}

string RunLengthDecoding (string const& s) {
    string decoding;
    for (int i = 1; i < s.size(); i+= 2) {
        char const& c = s[i];
        int len_sub_seq = s[i - 1] - '0'
        for (int j = 0; j < len_sub_seq; j++)
            decoding += c;
    }
    return decoding;
}
```

But this technique deals with single-digit numbers. What about double, triple, or more digit numbers?

```C++
string RunLengthEncoding (string const& s) {
    // let k = size_of_encoding
    // let count = len_sub_seq
    int k = 1, count = 1;
    char const& c = s[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < s.size(); i++) {
        if (s[i] != s[i - 1]) {
            k++;
            while (count) {
                k++;
                count /= 10;
            }
            //assert(count == 0);
        } else count++;
    }
    // check last time
    k++;
    while (count) {
        k++;
        count /= 10;
    }
    //assert(count == 0);

    string encoding(k, '0');
    // read again and store into encoding
    int write_ind = 0;
    int len_sub_seq = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < s.size(); i++) {
        if (s[i] != s[i - 1]) {
            while (count) {
                encoding[write_ind++] = (count % 10) + '0';
            }
            encoding[write_ind++] = s[i - 1];
        } else count++;
    }
    return encoding;
}

string RunLengthDecoding (string const& s) {
    string decoding;
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
        char const& c = s[i];
        if (c >= '0' && c <= '9') {
            count += c - '0';
            count *= 10;
        } else {
            while (count) {
                decoding += c;
                count--;
            }
        }
    }
    return decoding;
}
```


# 7.11 Implement Elias Gamma Encoding
The Elias gamma code is used to encode positive integers. Specifically, the Elias gamma code of a positive integer `n` is computed as follows.

1. Write `n` in binary to form string `b`.
2. Subtract 1 from the number of bits written in the first step, and add that many zeros to the beginning of string `b`.

For example, the binary representation of 13 is `1101`, which takes four bits to write. The Elias gamma code is `0001101`.

Let `A` be an array of `n` integers. Write an encode function that returns a string representation of the Elias gamma codes for `A[0], A[1], .., A[n-1]` in that order, and a decode function that takes a string `s` assumed to be generated by the encode function, and returns the array that was passed to the encode function.

## My Solution
```C++
string EliasGammaEncoding (vector<unsigned int> const& v) {
    string encoding;
    int num_bits = 0;
    for (unsigned int const& integer : v) {
        // count number of bits in integer
        unsigned int integer_copy = integer;
        while (integer_copy) {
            num_bits++;
            integer_copy >>= 1;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < num_bits - 1; i++)
            encoding += '0';
        while (integer) {
            encoding += (integer & 1) + '0';
            integer >>= 1;
        }
    }
    return encoding;
}

vector<unsigned int> EliasGammaDecoding (string const& s) {
    vector<unsigned int> decodings;
    bool pre_zone = true;
    size_t i = 0;
    int num_bits = 1;
    unsigned int integer = 0;
    while (i < s.size()) {
        if (s[i] != '0') pre_zone = false;
        if (!pre_zone) {
            while (num_bits) {
                integer += s[i++];
                integer <<= 1;
                num_bits--;
            }
            decodings.emplace_back(integer);  // integer = 0 side-effect
            pre_zone = true;
        } else {
            num_bits++;
            i++;
        }
    }
    return decodings;
}
```

Encode is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. Decode is also `O(n)`.


# 7.12 Implement the UNIX `tail` command
The UNIX `tail` command displays the last part of a file. For this problem, assume that `tail` takes two arguments -- a filename, and the number of lines, starting from the last line, that are to be printed.

Implement the UNIX `tail` command.

_Hint: Don't start at the beginning of the file._

## My Solution
```C++
#include <fstream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
string tail (string const& filename, int n) {
    string last_n_lines;
    ifstream ifs(filename, ifstream::in);
    if (!ifs) exit(1);

    // Get length of file
    ifs.seekg(0, ifs.end);
    int len = ifs.tellg();

    // search for '\n'
    int newline_count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        ifs.seekg(-1 - i; ifstream::end);
        char c;
        ifs.get(c);
        if (c == '\n') {
            ++newline_count;
            if (newline_count > n) break;
        }
        last_n_lines += c;
    }
    reverse(last_n_lines.begin(), last_n_lines.end());
    return last_n_lines;
}
```

# 7.13 Justify Text
This problem is concerned with justifying text. It abstracts a problem arising in type-setting. The input is specified as a sequence of words, and the target line length. After justification, each individual line must begin with a word, and each subsequent word must be separated from prior words with at least one blank. If a line contains more than one word, it should not end in a blank. The sequences of blanks within each line should be as close to equal in length as possible, with the longer blank sequences, if any, appearing at the initial part of the line. As an exception, the very last line should use single blanks as separators, with additional blanks appearing at its end.

For example, if `A = {"The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumped", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog."}` and the line length `L` is 11, then the returned result should be `"The___quick", "brown___fox", "jumped_over", "the____lazy", "dog._______`. The symbol `_` denotes a blank.

Write a program which takes as input an array `A` of strings and a positive integer `L`, and computes the justification of the text specified by `A`.

_Hint: Solve it on a line-by-line basis, assuming a single space between pairs of words. Then figure out how to distribute excess blanks._

## My Solution
```C++
vector<string> JustifyText (vector<string> const& A, int L) {
    // assume max word size <= L
    vector<string> paragraph;
    string sentence;
    size_t i = 0;
    while (i < A.size()) {
        string word = A[i];
        int j = i + 1;
        while (sentence.size() < L) {
            // expand
            if (j < A.size() &&
                sentence.size() + word.size() + A[j].size() < L - 2) {
                sentence += ' ';
                sentence += word;
                word = A[j];
                ++j;
            }
            // terminate
            else if (sentence.size() + word.size() < L - 1) {
                while (sentence.size() + word.size() < L) { sentence += ' '; }
                sentence += word;
                //assert(sentence.size() == L);
            }
        }
        i = j;
        paragraph.emplace_back(sentence);  // side effect: sentence = "";
    }
    // check last sentence
    sentence = paragraph.back();
    string last_sentence(' ', sentence.size());
    last_sentence[0] = sentence[0];
    for (i = 1; i < L; i++) {
        if ((sentence[i] == ' ' && sentence[i - 1] != ' ') ||
            (sentence[i] != ' '))
            last_sentence[i] = sentence[i];
    }
    paragraph[paragraph.size()-1] = last_sentence;
    return paragraph;
}
```

## Book Solution
The challenge in solving this problem is that it requires lookahead. Specifically, the number of spaces between words in a line cannot be computed until the complete set of words in that line is known.

We solve the problem on a line-by-line basis. First, we compute the words that go into each line, assuming a single space between words. After we know the words in a line, we compute the number of blanks in that line and distribute the blanks evenly. The final line is special-cased.

```C++
vector<string> JustifyText (vector<string> const& words, size_t L) {
    size_t curr_line_start = 0, num_words_curr_line = 0, curr_line_length = 0;
    vector<string> result;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i) {
        // curr_line_start is the first word in the current line, and i is used
        // to identify the last word
        ++num_words_curr_line;
        size_t lookahead_line_length = 
            curr_line_length + words[i].size() + (num_words_curr_line - 1);
        if (lookahead_line_length == L) {
            result.emplace_back(
                JoinALineWithSpace(words, curr_line_start, i,
                i - curr_line_start));
            curr_line_start = i + 1, num_words_curr_line = 0;
            curr_line_length = 0;
        } else if (lookahead_line_length > L) {
            result.emplace_back(JoinALineWithSpace(words, curr_line_start,
                i - 1, L - curr_line_length));
            curr_line_start = i, num_words_curr_line = 1;
            curr_line_length = words[i].size();
        } else {  // lookahead_line_length < L
            curr_line_length += words[i].size();
        }
    }
    // Handles the last line. Last line is to be left-aligned
    if (num_words_curr_line > 0) {
        string line = JoinALineWithSpace(words, curr_line_start,
            words.size() - 1, num_words_curr_line - 1);
        line.append(L - curr_line_length - (num_words_curr_line - 1), ' ');
        result.emplace_back(line);
    }
    return result;
}

// Joins strings in words[start : end] with num_spaces spaces spread evenly.
string JoinALineWithSpace (vector<string> const& words, size_t start,
                           size_t end, size_t num_spaces) {
    size_t num_words_curr_line = end - start + 1;
    string line;
    for (size_t i = start; i < end; ++i) {
        line += words[i];
        --num_words_curr_line;
        size_t num_curr_space = 
            ceil(static_cast<double>(num_spaces) / num_words_curr_line);
        line.append(num_curr_space, ' ' );
        num_spaces -= num_curr_space;
    }
    line += words[end];
    line.append(num_spaces, ' ');
    return line;

# 7.14 Find the first occurrence of a substring
A good string search algorithm is fundamental to the performance of many applications. Several clever algorithms have been proposed for string search, each with its own trade-offs. As a result, there is no single perfect answer. If someone asks you this question in an interview, the best way to approach this problem would be to work through one good algorithm in detail and discuss at a high level other algorithms.

Given two strings `s` (the "search string") and `t` (the "text"), find the first occurrence of `s` in `t`.

_Hint: Form a signature from a string._

## My Solution (Incorrect)
```
s = "oge"
t = "The quick brown doge jumped over a dog"

The quick brown doge jumped over a dog
            og   oge

s = "two two"
t = "one one one two twit two two two two"

one one one two twit two two two two
            two tw   two two

s = "aaaab"
t = "aaaaaaaaab"

aaaaaaaaab
aaaaaaaaa
```

```C++
ssize_t FindFirstOccurrence (string const& s, string const& t) {
    // assume s.size() <= t.size()
    size_t potential_i = 0, potential_j = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < t.size(); i++) {
        // check first char occurrence
        if (potential_j == 0 && t[i] == s[0])
            potential_i = i;
        if (t[i] == s[potential_j])
            ++potential_j;
        // reset potential_j
        else
            potential_j = 0;
        if (potential_j == s.size()) return potential_i;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

This solution requires `O(n)` time, where `n` is the length of `t`. Space is a constant `O(1)`. But this doesn't work for `s` = "aaaab", and `t` = "aaaaaaaaab".

## Book Solution
There are three linear-time string matching algorithms: KMP, Boyer-Moore, and Rabin-Karp. Of these, Rabin-Karp is by far the simplest to understand and implement.

The Rabin-Karp algorithm uses a concept of a "fingerprint". Specifically, let `m` be the length of `s`. It computes hash codes of each substring whose length is `m` - these are the fingerprints. The key to efficiency is using an incremental hash function, such as a function with the property that the hash code of a string is an additive function of each individual character. (Such a hash function is sometimes refered to as a rolling hash.) For such a function, getting the hash code of a sliding window of characters is very fast for each shift.

For example, let the strings consist of letters from "A, C, G, T". Suppose `t` is "GACGCCA", and `s` is "CGC". Define the code for "A" as 0, "C" as 1, etc etc. Let the hash function be the decimal number formed by the integer codes for the letters mod 31. The hash code of `s` is 121 mod 31 = 28. The hash code of the first three characters of `t`, "GAC" is 201 mod 31 = 15, so `s` cannot be the first three characters of `t`. Continuing, the next substring of `t` is "ACG", whose hash code can be computed from 15 by subtracting 200, then multiplying by 10, then adding 2 and finally taking mod 31. This yields 12, so there is no match yet. We then reach "CGC", whose hash code, 28, is derived in a similar manner. We are not done yet - there may be a collision. We check explicitly if the substring matches s, which in this case it does.

For the Rabin-Karp algorithm to run in linear time, we need a good hash function, to reduce the likelihood of collisions, which entail potentially time-consuming string equality checks.

```C++
int const kBase = 26, kMod = 997;

// Returns the index of the first character of the substring if found, -1
// otherwise
int RabinKarp (string const& t, string const& s) {
    if (s.size() > t.size()) return -1;

    int t_hash = 0, s_hash = 0;  // hash codes for t & s substrings
    int power_s = 1;  // modulo result of kBase^|s|
    for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
        power_s = i ? power_s * kBase & kMod : 1;
        t_hash = (t_hash * kBase + t[i]) % kMod;
        s_hash = (s_hash * kBase + s[i]) % kMod;
    }

    for (int i = s.size(); i < t.size(); ++i) {
        // in case of hash collision, explicitly check if
        // two substrings are actually equal
        if (t_hash == s_hash && !t.compare(i - s.size(), s.size(), s)) {
            return i = s.size();  // found a match
        }

        // Use rolling hash to compute the new hash code
        t_hash -= (t[i - s.size()] * power_s) % kMod;
        if (t_hash < 0) t_hash += kMod;
        t_hash = (t_hash * kBase + t[i]) % kMod;
    }

    // try to match s and t[t.size() - s.size() : t.size() - 1]
    if (t_hash == s_hash && t.compare(t.size() - s.size(), s.size(), s) == 0)
        return t.size() - s.size();
    return -1;  // s is not a substring of t
}
```
