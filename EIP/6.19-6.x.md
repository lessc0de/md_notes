This problem is motivated by the design of a packet sniffer that provides a uniform sample of packets for a network session.

Design an algorithm that reads packets and continuously maintains a uniform random subset of size `k` of the packets after `n >= k` packets are read.

_Hint: Suppose you have a procedure which selects `k` packets from the first `n >= k` packets as specified. How would you deal with the `(n + 1)`th packet?_

```C++
vector<int> ReservoirSampling (istringstream* sin, int k) {
	vector<int> reservoir;
	string packet;
	// 0 -> k
	for (int i = 0; i < k && *sin >> packet; i++)
		reservoir.emplace_back(packet);
	// k -> n
	int n = k;
	while (sin >> packet) {
		default_random_engine gen((random_device())());
		uniform_int_distribution<int> dis(0, n++);
		int sample = dis(gen);
		if (sample < k) reservoir[sample] = packet;
	}
	return reservoir;
}
```
Time complexity is `O(n)`, with space complexity `O(k)`.

# 6.20
Suppose you need to write a load test for a server. You have studied the inter-arrival time of requests to the server over a period of one year and from this data have computed a histogram of the distribution of the inter-arrival time of requests. In the load test you would like to generate requests for the server such that the inter-arrival times come from the same distribution that was observed in the historical data. The following problem formalizes the generation of inter-arrival times.

You are given `n` real numbers `t0, t1, ..., tn-1` and probabilities `p0, p1, ..., pn-1` which sum up to 1. Given a random number generator that produces values in `[0, 1]` uniformly, how would you generate a number in `T` according to the specified probabilities?

_Hint: Look at the graph of the probability that the number is less than or equal to `a`. What do the jumps correspond to?_

## My Solution
```C++
double SampleHistogram (vector<double> const& T, vector<double> const& P) {
	assert(T.size() == P.size());
	double sample = rng();  // [0, 1]

	auto itr_P = P.begin();
	double acc_prob = P.front();  // accumulated probability
	for (double t : T) {
		if (sample <= acc_prob) return t;
		acc_prob += *(++itr_P);
	}
	// never reached
	return P.back();
}
```

Time complexity is `O(n)` with `O(1)` space complexity.

An improvement would be to utilize binary search.

```C++
double SampleHistogram (vector<double> const& T, vector<double> const& P) {
	assert(T.size() == P.size());
	double sample = rng();  // [0, 1]
	vector<double>acc_probs; partial_sum(P.begin(), P.end(), acc_probs.begin());

	int n = T.size();
	int i = n / 2;
	while (n) {
		n /= 2;
		if (sample <= acc_probs[i]) {  // left
			if (sample > acc_probs[i - 1]) return T[i];
			i -= n / 2;
		} else // right
			i += n / 2;
	}

	// hack
	if (sample > acc_probs[T.size() / 2]) return T.back();
	return T.front();
}
```

Time complexity is `O(n)` for `partial_sum` and `O(log n)` for binary search. Space complexity in total is `O(n)`.
