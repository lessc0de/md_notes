# **5.11** p44 (39) -> p183 (178): Write a function that takes an integer and determines if that integer's representation as a decimal string is a palindrome.

## My Solution
```C
bool isPalindrome(int x) {
	if (x < 0) return false;
    if (x == 0) return true;
    int x0 = x;
    return reverseDigits(x) == x0;

# **5.12** p45 (40) -> p184 (179)
This problem is motivated by the following. Five friends have to select a designated driver using a single unbiased coin. The process should be fair to everyone.

How would you implement a random number generator that generates a random integer `i` between `a` and `b`, inclusive, given a random number generator that produces either zero or one with equal probability? All generated values should be equally likely.

## My Solution
```C
int RandRange(int a, int b) {
	// assume b >= a
    int result = 0;
    for (int i=0; i < b-a+1; ++i) {
    	result = result << 1 | rand();
    }
    if (result > b-a) {
    	RandRange(a, b);
    }
    return result + a;
    
}
```
Iterative Version
```C
int RandRange(int a, int b) {
	int result = 0;
    result = helper();
    while (result > b-a) {
    	result = helper(a, b);
    }
    return result + a;
}

int helper(int a, int b) {
	int result = 0;
	for (int i=0; i < b-a+1; ++i) {
    	result =  result << 1 | rand();
    }
    return result;
}
```
## Book's Solution
```C
int UniformRandom(int a, int b) {
	int t = b - a + 1, res;
    do {
    	for (int i=0; (1 << i) < t; ++i) {
        	res = (res * 2) | ZeroOneRandom();
        }
    } while (res >= t);
    return res + a;
}

Rect Intersection(const Rect& r1, const Rect& r2) {
	if (isIntersect(r1, r2) {
    	return {
        	max(r1.x, r2.x),
            max(r1.y, r2.y),
            min(r1.x+r1.w, r2.x+r2.w) - max(r1.x, r2.x),
            min(r1.y+r1.h, r2.y+r2.h) - max(r1.y, r2.y)
        };
    }
    return {0, 0, -1, -1};
}

bool isIntersect(const Rect& r1, const Rect& r2) {
	return r1.x <= r2.x + r2.w && r1.x + r1.w >= r2.x &&
    	   r1.y <= r2.y + r2.h && r1.y + r1.h >= r2.y;
}
```
This solution is much simpler. The number of cases which can be considered an intersection is plentiful (see my solution). However, the cases where there is NO intersection is much smaller. So let's just test for non-intersections instead, since they are much better enumerable.

Instead of using `>` or `<`, instead, use `max` or `min`.


# **5.14** p45 (40) -> p186 (181)
500 closed doors along a cooridor are numbered from 1 to 500. A person walks through the corridor and opens each door. Another person walks through the corridor and closes every alternate door. Continuing in this manner, the `ith` person comes and toggles the position of every `ith` door starting from door `i`.

Which doors are open after the 500th person has walked through?

## Solution

	sqrt(500) = 22.36 ~= 22
    22 * 22 = 484
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22

The above numbered doors are open.

# **5.15** p45 (40) -> p186 (181)
Design an efficient algorithm for computing the GCD of two numbers without using multiplication, division, or the modulus operators.

## Solution
Using prime factorizations isn't allowed b/c it's not very efficient.

Using Euclid's algorithm isn't allowed b/c it involves the modulo operator.

We are left with the binary GCD algorithm that performs as follows:

Let `a` and `b` be 2 non-negative integers. Set `d` to 1. There are 4 cases.

1. `a` and `b` are even
  * Both are divisible by 2, so divide both by 2 (`>> 1` operation) and multiply `d` by 2. Continue.
2. `a` is even, `b` is odd
  * Only `a` is divisible by 2, so divide `a` only by 2. Continue.
3. `a` is odd, `b` is even
  * Only `b` is divisible by 2, so divide `b` only by 2. Continue.
4. `a` and `b` are odd
  * let `c = abs(a - b)/2`
  * `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, c) = gcd(b, c)`
  * For computational efficiency, we choose `gcd(a, c)` if `a < b` and vice versa
    * e.g. we perform `gcd(min(a, b), c)`

Continue performing the algorithm until `c == 0`; at which point return `d`.
```C
int gcd(int a, int b) {
	// extreme cases
	if (a == 0 && b == 0) exit(1);
    if (a < 0 || b < 0) exit(1);
    
    // base cases
    if (a == 0) return b;
	if (b == 0) return a;
	if (a == b) return a;
    
    // recursive cases
    if ((a & 1) == 0 && (b & 1) == 0)
        return gcd(a>>1, b>>1) << 1;
    if ((a & 1) == 0)
    	return gcd(a>>1, b);
    if ((b & 1) == 0)
    	return gcd(a, b>>1);
    int c = abs(a - b) >> 1;  // c allowed to be 0 (will reach a base case)
    return gcd(min(a, b), c);
}
```

As an aside, we will consider Euclid's algorithm:

Given `a >= b`...

* `gcd(a, 0) := a`
* `gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b)`

```C
uint64_t gcd(uint64_t a, uint64_t b) {
	// extreme case
    if (a == 0 && b == 0) exit(1);
    
    // base case
    if (min(a, b) == 0) return max(a, b);
    
    // recursive case
    uint64_t c = max(a, b), d = min(a, b);
    return gcd(d, c % d);
}
```
