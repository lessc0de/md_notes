# **5.1**, p42 (37) -> p176 (171): How would you compute the parity of a very large number of 64-bit words?

## Brute-Force Algorithm
The brute-force algorithm iteratively tests the value of each bit, and keeps the running XOR of the bits processed.
```C
short parity(unsigned long x) {
	short result = 0;
    while (x) {
    	result = result ^ (x & 1);
    	x >>= 1;
    }
    return result;
}
```
Explanation:

* Iterate thru the bits of `x` with `while(x)` and `x >>= 1`.
* The "current" or "focused" bit is the lowest bit, selected by `(x & 1)`
* The `XOR (^)` in an `x ^ y` expr "turns on" `x` if `x` is NOT EQUAL to `y` (i.e. `x != y`)
  * `x=1,y=0`: `x ^ y == 1`
  * `x=0,y=1`: `x ^ y == 1`
* Similarly, `XOR (^)` "turns off" `x` if `x` is EQUAL to `y` (i.e. `x == y`)
  * `x=0,y=0`: `x ^ y == 0`
  * `x=1,y=1`: `x ^ y == 0`
* We can use `^` to "flip" `result` everytime the "current" bit is `1`. After all, this is how parity works. We count parity as `even (0)`, `odd (1)`, `even (0)`, `odd (1)`, etc... everytime we encounter the `1` bits while traversing a bitstring/word: 
  * `parity(0000) = 0`
  * `parity(0001) = 1`
  * `parity(0010) = 1`
  * `parity(0011) = 0`
  * `parity(0100) = 1`
  * etc.

Complexity: let `k` be the number of bits set to 1 in a particular word. Then, the complexity is `O(k)`. In a 64-bit word, `k` is around 32.

Notice that we are `XOR`ing `result` with **every** bit in the bitstring  
E.g. for `x = 01110110`, we're performing `result ^ 0 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 0 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 0`, with `result` initialized to `0`. Can we reduce the number of `XOR` operations needed?

## Cache with a LUT
We can precompute the parity such that the parity operation is `O(1)` at runtime. A precomputed LUT can 64-bit words to parity. But the LUT will need  2^64 spaces to fill up, which is way too much. How can we get around this?

Note also that `XOR` is associative, i.e. `x ^ y ^ z == x ^ (y ^ z)`.  
This means `result ^ (0 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 0) ^ (1 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 0)` gives the same answer.

We can thus exploit the associative property of `XOR` to allow us to cache the parity of smaller words and then `XOR` those parities to get the overall larger word parity.

In this problem, we maintain one 16-bit word parity LUT, which is of length 2^16 = 65536. The LUT can be statically or lazily initialized (if lazily, then indicate if the entry in the LUT is valid)
```C
short Parity(unsigned long x) {
	const int word_size = 16;
    const int bit_mask = 0xFFFF;
	return 0 ^
    	(precomputed_parity[(x >> 3*word_size) & bit_mask]) ^
        (precomputed_parity[(x >> 2*word_size) & bit_mask]) ^
        (precomputed_parity[(x >> 1*word_size) & bit_mask]) ^
        (precomputed_parity[(x >> 0*word_size) & bit_mask]);
}
```
## Parallel Execution of `XOR`
Instead of `XOR`ing one bit to another one bit at each step, it would be faster to `XOR` multiple bits in a single step; after all, `XOR` was designed to work on bitstrings/words (like bytes), not bits.

When `XOR` is used in this "parallel" manner, say `A _^ B` (where `A` and `B` are disparate collections of bits), every bit in `A` is `^`'d to the corresponding bit in `B`:

	A: 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0
       ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
    B: 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0

As you can see above:

1. `_^` takes two disparate bitstrings,
2. and for each bit of `A` and its corresponding bit in `B`
3. parallely create an `XOR` expression with those two bits (one from `A`, one from `B`).
4. `_^` composes N `^` expressions (N is the length of `A` or `B`) from 2N bits.

This "creating N expressions from 2N inputs" behavior can be thought of as creating N strings from 2N smaller strings.

Since bits themselves can equal the result of an `XOR` expression (e.g. `0 ^ 1 = 1`), we can use `_^` to compose an `XOR` expression from two `XOR` expressions, just like how we can compose an `XOR` expression from two bits:

	----------------------
	A^B high half: 1 1 1 0
    			   ^ ^ ^ ^
    			   0 0 1 0
    ----------------------
    			   ^ ^ ^ ^
    ----------------------
    A^B low half:  0 0 1 0
    			   ^ ^ ^ ^
    			   0 1 1 0
	----------------------

From above, we can see that we had 8 inputs (each was an `XOR` expr itself) and composed 4 outputs (again, each was a `XOR` expr itself, but bigger than any of the inputs). It looks like we're gluing small strings into bigger strings. It is easy to see how we can recursively perform this operation to build a single large string from multiple smaller strings.

This useful for our parity problem? Well, in our problem, we want `a ^ b ^ c ^ d ^ ...`, where `abcd` are the bits of the 64-bit word; this is a single `XOR` expression. We'll just `_^` all bits, and then `_^` the resulting `XOR` expressions recursively until we end up with one `XOR` expression!

_Note that this technique works because `XOR` satisfies the commutative property, or  
I.e. `a ^ b ^ c ^ d == a ^ c ^ b ^ d == c ^ d ^ b ^ a == ...`._
```C
short Parity(unsigned long x) {
	x ^= x >> 32;
    x ^= x >> 16;
    x ^= x >> 8;
    x ^= x >> 4;
    x ^= x >> 2;
    x ^= x >> 1;
    return x & 1;
}
```
Explanation:

1. Start by `XOR`ing the left half of bits to the right half of bits. The left half of bits is now done processing: what we have done is equivalent to parallely performing 32 `XOR` exprs, each with 2 operands; every bit in the 64-bit word was an operand.
2. Next, `XOR` the left half of the right half with the right half of the right half. The left half of the right half is now done with processing: we have effectively processed 16 `XOR` exprs, each with 4 operands.
3. Continue this recursive process. After another step, we have effectively processed 8 `XOR` exprs, each with 8 operand bits.
4. We recurse this process until all bits are "connected" in 1 long `XOR` expr consisting of 64 operand bits.

# **5.2**, p42-43 (37-38) -> p178 (173)
A 64-bit integer can be viewed as an array of 64 bits, with the bit @ index 0 corresponding to the least significant bit (LSB), and the bit at index 63 corresponding to the most significant bit (MSB). Implement code that takes as input a 64-bit integer and swaps the bits in that integer at indices _`i`_ and _`j`_.

## Solution
```C
long SwapBits(long x, int i, int j) {
    if (((x >> i) & 1) != ((x >> j) & 1))
    	x ^= (1L << j) | (1L << i);
	return x;
}
```
Explanation:

1. `(x >> i) & 1` tests presence of `ith` bit of `x`; `(x >> j) & 1` tests presence of `jth` bit of `x`
2. if `(x >> i) & 1` and `(x >> j) & 1` equal, then effectively `x[i] == x[j]`, so no swap is needed...
3. otherwise, flip the `ith` and `jth` bits of `x` through `XOR`


# **5.3**, p43 (38) -> p178 (173): Write a function that takes a 64-bit word `x` and returns a 64-bit word consisting of `x` in reverse order.

## Brute Force Algorithm
```C
uint64_t ReverseBits(uint64_t x) {
	for (int i=0; i < 32; i++)
    	swapBits(x, i, 63-i);
	return x;
}
```
Complexity is `O(k)`, where `k` is bit-length (64).

## Recursive, Logarithmic Algorithm
Consider the following:

	swap(A B)
         B A

Easy. But what if `A` is `{a1 a2}` and `B` is `{b1 b2}`?

	swap(A B)
         B A
         b1 b2 a1 a2  X CONFLICT!
    
    we need to swap within B and A...
    
    	 b2 b1 a2 a1  . PASS!

Alright, but what if `a1 = {x, y}, a2 = {z, t}, b1 = {i, j}, b2 = {k, l}`?

	swap(A B)
    swap(B) swap(A)
    swap(b1 b2) swap(a1 a2)
    swap(b2) swap(b1) swap(a2) swap(a1)
    swap(k l) swap(i j) swap(z t) swap(x y)
    l k j i t z y x  . PASS!

Okay, it seems that if we want to reverse a sequence, we can think of a sequence constructed of two inner sequences. Each sequence is subsequently constructed of 2 even smaller sequences. The smallest sequence is of a single element. Now, we just need to swap the inner sequence for every sequence, recursively!

_Note: this recursion holds true for only sequences of length that is a power of 2._
```C
uint64_t ReverseBits(uint64_t x) {
	// swap left half w/ right half
    x = ((x & 0xFFFFFFFF00000000) >> 32) | ((x & 0x00000000FFFFFFFF) << 32);
    // swap inner left halves w/ inner right halves
    x = ((x & 0xFFFF0000FFFF0000) >> 16) | ((x & 0x0000FFFF0000FFFF) << 16);
    // swap inner inner l's w/ inner inner r's
    x = ((x & 0xFF00FF00FF00FF00) >> 8) | ((x & 0x00FF00FF00FF00FF) << 8);
    // ...
    x = ((x & 0xF0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0) >> 4) | ((x & 0x0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F) << 4);
    x = ((x & 0xCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC) >> 2) | ((x & 0x3333333333333333) << 2);
    x = ((x & 0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA) >> 1) | ((x & 0x5555555555555555) << 1);
	return x;
}
```
## Cache with LUT
Alternatively, we can split a 64-bit word into 4 16-bit words, and then cache the reverse of every 16-bit word into a LUT table. This LUT table must be statically initialized or lazily initialized.
```C
uint64_t ReverseBits(uint64_t x) {
	const int mask = 0xFFFF;
	return (precomputed_reverse[x & mask] << 48) |
    	(precomputed_reverse[x >> 16 & mask] << 32) |
        (precomputed_reverse[x >> 32 & mask] << 16) |
        (precomputed_reverse[x >> 48 & mask]);
}
```

# **5.4**, p43 (38) -> p179 (174)
Write a function which takes as input a non-negative integer `x` and returns `y != x` such that `y` has the same weight as `x`, and the difference of `x` and `y` is as small as possible. You can assume `x` is not `0`, or all `1`s.

## My Solution
```C
unsigned long ClosestIntSameBits(unsigned long x) {
	if (x & 1) {  // check if LSB is lowest set bit
    	short s = len_of_LSBs(x);
        x += 1;
        if (s-1) {
        	unsigned long q = 1;
            while (s-1) {
            	q = q << 1 | 1;
            	s--;
            }
            x |= q;
        }
    } else {
    	const unsigned long y = x & ~(x - 1);  // y == lowest set bit of x
        x = x & ~y | y >> 1;  // unset lowest set bit and set bit right of y
    }
    return x;
}

short len_of_LSBs(unsigned long x) {
	// assume lowest set bit is LSB
    unsigned long xc = x;  // xc is copy of x
    short len = 0;
    while (xc & 1) {
    	len++;
        xc >>= 1;
    }
    return len;
}
```
Explanation:

* If LSB is lowest set bit, then...
  1. you must put the `1` above the LSBs.
  2. If `s = len(LSBs)`, then you must set the `s-1` least significant bits
* Else,
  1. Observe where the lowest set bit is and turn it off
  2. Turn on the bit immediately to the right of the (previously) lowest set bit


# **5.5**, p43 (38) -> p179 (174-175)
Write a function that multiplies two non-negative integers. The only operators you are allowed to use are assignment and the bitwise operators, i.e. `>>`, `<<`, `|`, `&`, `~`, and `^`. You cannot use increment or decrement (`++` or `--`). You may use loops, conditionals, and functions that you write yourself.

## My Solution
```C
unsigned int add(unsigned t, unsigned b) {
	unsigned c = (t & b) << 1;  // carry-out
    unsigned x = t ^ b;  // carry-in
    while (c) {
    	t = x;
        b = c;
        c = (t & b) << 1;
        x = t ^ b;
    }
    return x;
}

unsigned multiply(unsigned x, unsigned y) {
	unsigned p = 0;
    unsigned xc = x;
    while (xc) {
    	xc = add(xc, 0xFFFFFFFF);  // hack to decrement xc by 1
    	p = add(p, y);
    }
    return p;
}
```
Complexity is `O(x)`. This sucks if `x > 32`, the width of `unsigned`.

## Book's Solution
```C
unsigned MultiplyNoOperator(unsigned x, unsigned y) {
	unsigned sum = 0;
    while (x) {
    	if (x & 1) {
        	sum = AddNoOperator(sum, y);
        }
        x >>= 1, y <<= 1;
    }
}
```
Explanation:

* `x = 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1`
* `y = 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1`
* `x = 2**3 + 2**0 = (1 << 3) + 1`
* `y = 3`
* `xy = (2**3 + 2**0)*3 = (1 << 3)*3 + (1 << 0)*3 = (3 << 3) + (3 << 0)`

Complexity is `O(N)`, where `N` is the width of `unsigned`.
