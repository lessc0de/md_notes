# **6.7**, p48 (43) -> p192 (187)
Let _A_ be an array of length _n_. Design an algorithm to find the smallest positive integer which is not present in _A_. You do not need to preserve the contents of _A_. For example, if _A_ = `3 5 4 -1 5 1 -1`, the smallest positive integer not present in _A_ is 2.

## My Solution
Using the strategy of the solutions for **6.6, and 6.5**, we can first remove negatives and zeros (`O(n)`) so that we'll see only positive integers. Then we sort _A_ (`O(n lg(n))`) with quicksort (3-way is robust to duplicates). We sort because we can remove duplicates easily from sorted arrays; we remove duplicates (`O(n)`). Finally, we are left with a sorted array of unique elements. We want to find `A[i]` such that `A[i+1] != A[i] + 1`. If this `i` is found, then `A[i+1]` must be greater than `A[i] + 1`, so the answer is `A[i] + 1`, i.e. the _smallest, positive_ integer.
```C
int SmallestPosInt(int A[], int n) {
	// 1. Remove negatives & zeros
    int hi = 0;
    for (int i=0; i < n; i++) {
    	if (A[i] > 0)
        	A[hi++] = A[i];
    }
    hi--;  // inclusive
    
    // 2. 3-way Quicksort
    ThreeWayQuickSort(A, hi+1);
    
    // 3. Remove duplicates from sorted array
    int j = 0;
    for (int i=0; i <= hi; i++) {
    	if (A[i] != A[j])
        	A[++j] = A[i];
    }
    
    // 4. Find A[i] s.t. A[i+1] != A[i] + 1
    hi = j;  // inclusive
    for (int i=0; i < hi; i++) {
    	if (A[i+1] != A[i] + 1)
        	return A[i] + 1;
    }
    return A[hi] + 1;
}
```
Since the sort has highest time complexity, the overall algorithm complexity is `O(n lg(n))`.


## Book Solution
```C++
int FindFirstMissingPositive(vector<int> A) {
	// Record which values are present by writing A[i] to index A[i] - 1 if A[i]
    // is between 1 and A.size(), inclusive. We save the value at index
    // A[i] - 1 by swapping it with the entry at i. If A[i] is negative or
    // greater than n, we just advance i.
    size_t i = 0;
    while (i < A.size()) {
    	if (A[i] > 0 && A[i] <= A.size() && A[A[i] - 1] != A[i])
        	swap(A[i], A[A[i] - 1]);
        else
        	++i;
    }
    
    // Second pass through A to search for the first index i such that
    // A[i] != i+1, indicating that i+1 is absent. If all numbers between 1
    // and A.size() are present, the smallest positive is A.size() + 1.
    for (i = 0; i < A.size(); ++i) {
    	if (A[i] != i + 1)
        	return i + 1;
    }
    return A.size() + 1;
}
```
The magic happens in the first pass. What does it do exactly?

Imagine our array is `A = {3, 5, 4, -1, 5, 1, -1}`.

We can remove negatives, zeros, and integers greater than _n_ in a prior pass, or we can just ignore/skip them (which saves us a pass). But here, let's remove them in a prior pass anyawys:

`A = {3, 5, 4, 5, 1}`

Now, the first pass does the following:

_`(3)`_ _`5`_ _`4`_ _`5`_ _`1`_			starting position  
_`(4)`_ _`5`_ **`3`** _`5`_ _`1`_		3 is in correct position  
_`(5)`_ _`5`_ **`3`** **`4`** _`1`_		3 & 4 are in correct positions  
_`(1)`_ _`5`_ **`3`** **`4`** **`5`**	3, 4, & 5 are in correct positions  
**`1`** _`(5)`_ **`3`** **`4`** **`5`**	1, 3, 4, & 5 are in correct positions  
**`1`** _`5`_ **`(3)`** **`4`** **`5`**	1, 3, 4, & 5 are in correct positions  
**`1`** _`5`_ **`3`** **`(4)`** **`5`**	1, 3, 4, & 5 are in correct positions  
**`1`** _`5`_ **`3`** **`4`** **`(5)`**	1, 3, 4, & 5 are in correct positions; **reached end**  

You can see that the algorithm first swaps the value at `i=0` into its correct position, and continues to do so until the value at `i=0` is in the correct position. The algorithm then updates `i++` and starts the process again. The algorithm quits this stage once `i` has reached the end, meaning the algorithm has effectively "passed" through the entire array and checked that as many positive integers as possible are in their correct positions.

In the 2nd pass, we check for which position doesn't have it's correct value. Above, that index is `i=1`, which is supposed to contain the value 2. Thus, 2 is the lowest positive integer not contained in the array. The whole algorithm takes `O(n)` time!

This algorithm is a kind of "numerical" sorting, where order of an element is not determined _relative_ to elements left and right of it, but rather determined by its position index of the array.


## My solution with book strategy
```C
int SmallestPosInt(int A[], int n) {
	// 1. Remove negatives, zeros, and elements greater than n
    int i;
    int j = 0;
    for (i=0; i < n; i++) {
    	if (A[i] > 0 && A[i] <= n)
        	A[j++] = A[i];
    }
    
    // 2. Traverse A, making sure each int is in its correct position
    i = 0;
    while (i < j) {
    	// Is A[i] not in correct position (A[i] == i+1)? Then swap it to there!
       	if (A[i] != i+1)
        	exch(A, i, A[i]-1);
        else  // A[i] is in correct position (A[i] == i). Check next index.
        	i++;
    }
    
    // 3. Pass A, finding the first index such that A[i] != i+1
    for (i=0; i <= j; i++) {
    	if (A[i] != i+1)
        	return i+1;
    }
    return j+1;
}
```
This solution is easier to understand. It is also `O(n)` time complexity.


# **6.8**, p49 (44) -> p194 (189)
A robot needs to travel along a path that includes several ascents and descents. When it goes up, it uses its battery to power the motor and when it descends, it recovers the energy which is stored in the battery. The battery recharging process is ideal: on descending, every Joule of gravitational potential energy converts to a Joule of electrical energy which is stored in the battery. The battery has a limited capacity and ocne it reaches this capacity, the energy generated in descending is lost.

Design an algorithm that takes a sequence of _n_ three-dimensional coordinates to be traversed, and returns the minimum battery capacity needed to complete the journey. The robot begins with the battery fully charged.

## My Solution
Let's implement the solution as an implementation of a finite state machine (FSM). The machine can be in 4 states:

1. Starting point
  * Initialize _max_ = 0, _potential_ = 0
2. Increasing
  * Record _potential_
3. Decreasing
  * Set _max_ to _potential_ if _potential_ > _max_
  * Record _potential_
  * if _potential_ reaches < 0, reset _potential_ = 0
4. Level
  * Skip to next point
5. Ending point
  * Set _max_ to _potential_ if _potential_ > _max_
  * return _max_

This FSM can be coded...
```C
int MinBatteryCapacity(int C[], int N) {
	/* Starting Point */
	// init max = 0, potential = 0
    int max = 0, potential = 0;
    
    // traverse through coordinates array C
    size_t i = 0;
    while (i < N-1) {
   		/* Increasing */
        if (C[i + 1] > C[i])
        	// increase potential
        	potential += C[i + 1] - C[i];
        
        /* Decreasing */
    	if (C[i + 1] < C[i]) {
        	// before recording potential, set max if potential > max
            max = (max > potential) ? max : potential;
        	// decrease potential
            potential += C[i + 1] - C[i];
        }
        
        /* Level */
        {}
        
        // Potential capacity cannot be less than 0
        if (potential < 0) potential = 0;
        
        i++;
    }
    /* Ending point */
    if (potential > max) max = potential;
    return max;
}
```
... and simplified:
```C
#include <limits.h>
#include <stddef.h>

int MinBatteryCapacity(int C[], int N) {
	if (N <= 1) { perror("N <= 1"; exit(1); }
	// initial Values
	int capacity = INT_MIN;
	int potential = 0;
	
	for (size_t i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
		// potential is current local max diff
		potential += C[i + 1] - C[i];
		
		// potential > capacity -> update capacity
		if (potential > capacity) capacity = potential;
		
		// potential < 0 -> reset potential to 0 & start counting potential from there
		if (potential < 0) potential = 0;
	}
	return (cap > 0) ? cap : 0;
}
```

## Book Solution
```C++
int FindBatteryCapacity(const vector<int>& h) {
	int min_height = numeric_limits<int>::max(), capacity = 0;
    for (const int &height : h) {
    	capacity = max(capacity, height - min_height);
        min_height = min(min_height, height);
    }
    return capacity;
}
```
The book solution is exactly the same, only using C++11 syntax and has a more appropriate variable naming style. Also, it uses absolute difference `potential = C[i] - min_height` to achieve the function rather than with segment-by-segment accumulation `potential += C[i+1] - C[i]`.
```C
int MinBatteryCapacity(int C[], int N) {
	// initial values
	int min_height = INT_MAX;
    int capacity = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    	// potential is current local max diff
    	int potential = C[i] - min_height;
        
        // potential > capacity -> update capacity
    	if (potential > capacity) capacity = potential;
        
        // potential < 0 -> re-set min_height & start counting potential w.r.t. it
        if (potential < 0) min_height = C[i];
    }
}
```

For each of the following, _A_ is an integer array of length _n_.

1. What is the maximum profit that can be made by buying and selling a share two times over a given day range?
2. What is the maximum profit that can be made by buying and selling a share _k_ times over a given day range? Here _k_ is a fixed input parameter.

## My Solution
```C
#include <limits.h>
#include <stddef.h>

int TopMaxDiff(int A[], int lo, int hi) {
	if (hi <= lo) return INT_MIN;
    int maxval = INT_MIN;

        if (a > maxval) maxval = a;
        
        // a < 0 -> reset a to 0 & start counting a from there
        else if (a < 0) a = 0;
    }
    return (maxval > 0) ? maxval : 0;
}

int SumTop2MaxDiff(int A[], int n) {
	//if (n <= 2) { perror("n <= 2"); exit(1); }
    
	// initial values
	int maxval = INT_MIN, a = 0;
    int left = 0, right = 1;
    int maybe_left = 0;
    
    for (size_t i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
    	// a is current local max diff
        a += A[i + 1] - A[i];
        
        // a > maxval -> update maxval, left & right
        if (a > maxval) {
            left = maybe_left;
            right = i + 1;
            maxval = a;
        }
        
        // a < 0 -> reset a to 0; start counting a from here
        else if (a < 0) {
            maybe_left = i + 1;
        	a = 0;
        }
    }
    if (maxval < 0) return 0;
	int max_left = TopMaxDiff(A, 0, left - 1);
    int max_right = TopMaxDiff(A, right + 1, n-1);
    int maxval2 = (max_left > max_right) ? max_left : max_right;
    return maxval + maxval2;
}


```
This solution is `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space.`

### Explanation
The solution is achieved from a dynamic programming approach. In this approach, we are looking for a recurrence relationship between the metric for a sequence of items and the metric for a smaller, contiguous sub-sequence of items. Then we pretend we know the value of the metric for a smaller sub-sequence and apply the recurrence relation to obtain the value of the metric for a (larger) sequence.

In this problem, there are 2 sequences to consider:u

1. the stock prices over `n` days
2. the `2k` actions to take

Our problem wants to find the maximum profit using `k` transactions (i.e. `2k` actions) over the `n` days. This is our metric. So let's define the metric (maximum profit) as

	P(i, j)

where `i` denotes the `i`th sub-sequence of stock prices, and `j` denotes the `j`th sub-series of actions to take. Remember that a series of actions must be first Buy, then Sell, then Buy, etc...

Should each stock price sub-sequence start from the beginning or the end of the whole sequence? It should start from the beginning. Why? Recall this sentence from before:

> Then we pretend we know the value of the metric for a smaller sub-sequence and apply the recurrence relation to obtain the value of the metric for a (larger) sequence.

You can see intuitively that if you know the profit (and the series of actions that lead to that profit) from the items before the current item, you can just copy that series of actions for those specified items, and then perform one more action on the current item. You may see that this may or may not be the optimal choice, but it is nonetheless a _possible_ choice. Remember, our metric is like a maximum function: it considers all possible candidate solutions and picks the best one.

What about `j`? It is also intuitive to guess that the sub-series of actions should start from the beginning of the whole series, since you perform a Buy _after_ a sub-series of `Buy->Sell->Buy->Sell`, a Sell _after_ a sub-series of `Buy->Sell->Buy`, etc etc.

So where does all this reasoning lead us? A foundation for our recurrence relation!

	P(i, j) = f(P(i-1, j), P(i, j-1), P(i-1, j-1))

`P(i, j-1)` doesn't make sense because it means maximum profit of `j-1`, which is orthogonal to the maximum profit of `j`. I.e. they're two different solutions to two different problems (each with its own `k` value). Let's change the recurrence:

	P(i, j) = f(P(i-1, j), P(i-1, j-1))

1. `P(i-1, j-1)` makes sense because `P(i, j)` could be `P(i-1, j-1) +/- A[i]`, where `+/-` represents sell/buy respectively. This means you do the best series of actions for items before the `i`th item, then buy/sell the `i`th item (`+/- A[i]`).

2. `P(i-1, j)` also makes sense because `P(i, j)` could also be `P(i-1, j)` because `P(i-1, j-1) +/- A[i]` is worse than `P(i-1, j)` - the series of `j` actions where you don't even consider the `i`th item.

So what is the form of the function `f`? Notice our metric is _maximum profit_. Maximum. This means we find candidate solutions and pick the _max_ (best) one out of them. We're trying to find the better of the 2 above options, so it's natural for `f` to be the `max` function:

	P(i, j) = max(P(i-1, j), P(i-1, j-1) +/- A[i])

Okay, so we finally have the recurrence relation. We want to apply it from smaller sub-sequence to bigger sequences. Let's paint the Direct Acyclic Graph as well as find base/edge cases:

	P(0,0)
    P(1,0) P(1,1)
    P(2,0) P(2,1) P(2,2)
    P(3,0) P(3,1) P(3,2) P(3,3)
    ...

It doesn't make sense for `j>i`, so we'll ignore those. Also, `i` and `j` cannot be less than 0, so we'll define base cases for `P(i,0) = max(P(i-1, j), 0 - A[i])`. `P(1,1)`, `P(2,2)`, ..., `P(i=j)` are defined as `P(i-1, j-1) +/- A[i])` - no max because taking `j` actions on `i` items means you are literally buying and selling every single day.

What is the maximum profit that can be made by buying and selling a share any number of times over a given day range?

My Solution:
```C
int MaxProfits(int A[], int N) {
	int profit = 0;
	for (int i=0; i < N-1; i++) {
		int v = A[i+1] - A[i];
		// increasing
		if (v > 0)
			profit += v;
	}
	return profit;
}
```

Book Solution:
```C++
int MaxProfitUnlimitedPairs(const vector<int>& A) {
	int profit = 0;
	for (int i = 1; i < A.size(); ++i) {
		int delta = A[i] - A[i - 1];
		if (delta > 0) {
			profit += delta;
		}
	}
	return profit;
}
```
